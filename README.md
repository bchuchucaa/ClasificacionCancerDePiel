## SKIN CANCER ISIC DATASET
EN. This set consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

actinic keratosis
basal cell carcinoma
dermatofibroma
melanoma
nevus
pigmented benign keratosis
-seborrheic keratosis
squamous cell carcinoma
vascular lesion
